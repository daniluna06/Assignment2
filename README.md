This virtual museum gives you a small glimpse into the universe that we live in, beginning with the Big Bang Theory, and ending with the future of our planet Earth.

## Station 1: The Big Bang- The Dark Ages
In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble was observing distant galaxies by using a powerful telescope. By looking, he made two discoveries. The first discovery he made was that the Milky Way was not the only galaxy to exist. When he was looking at the faint cloud-like objects in the night sky he realized they were actually other galaxies, which made him realize that the Milky Way was just one out of the billions of galaxies. Hubble's second discovery was that galaxies kept drifting away from each other. Which meant that the universe is still expanding and growing bigger over time.   

Years later, another astronomer, Georges Lemaitre, had used Hubble's discoveries to answer the big question of how did the universe started. This led to the idea being known as the Big Bang. The Big Bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago, when the universe was just a small fireball that exploded. However, it is still a mystery what caused the explosion to happen.   

You'll notice that this exhibit is the only one without an light in the area. That's because the very early beginning of the universe was known as "The Dark Ages." The white color that you see is purely for visibility, but keep in mind that there was no light. Proceed to Exhibit #2 to learn more.

## Station 2: Stars
Stars and The Epoch of Reionization:
Although no one knows yet exactly how long ago the very first stars began to form, the epoch of reionization marks a crucial period that ended the Universe's "dark ages." About 400,000 years after the Big Bang, nearly all hydrogen gas was neutral: each hydrogen atom had one positively charged proton, and one negatively charged electron. The attraction between these two particles is what holds the atom together. In a process called ionization, light with enough energy- such as ultraviolet light- can knock the electron free. This radiation knocked electrons free from surrounding hydrogen atoms, leaving behind protons and creating regions of ionized hydrogen. Over the first billion years, more and more of these ionized regions appeared and expanded, eventually overlapping. Because opposite charges attract, free protons and electrons naturally tend to recombine into neutral hydrogen. A hydroden atom with only one proton will attract an electron. In this process, most of the intergalactic hydrogen atoms were reionized. This landmark transition ended the dark ages and heated the cosmic gas by thousands of degrees, setting the stage for how the Universe evolved afterward. BONUS 2: ANIMATION

## Station 3: The Sun
The galaxy is made from gas, dust, and stars that are bound together by gravity. Galaxies contain stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust. They all come in different shapes and sizes, mostly spirals and ellipticals. The universe has a lot of galaxies, and the Milky Way is one of them. Most of the largest galaxies have a big black hole in the center. The average ages for them are 10 billion to 13.6 billion years old. There are some that are the same age as the universe.

## Station 4: The Solar System
A planet is an object that orbits around a star. There are some rules to qualify as a planet, the object must be large enough that gravity has squeezed it into a spherical or round shape. Also, it should be large enough for any rocky or icy objects that come in its path around the star that gravity has to sweep up.  Scientists believed that a nebula, a dense cloud of dust and gas that orbits around a newly created star, is how planets started to form. Gravity is a key part that causes a small amount of matter in the nebula to bind together.

## Station 5: Earth
The Future of Earth: After all that has happened throughout the history of the Universe, it would be a shame if the Earth got to this point only to regress within the next few centuries, which is what scientists are predicting if humans don't take action to prevent future harm from climate change. Research shows that planet Earth is closer than we once thought to "tipping points"- moments where natural ecosystems, like the Amazon rainforest or the Antarctic ice sheet, could collapse or change in ways that cannot be reversed. If ice sheets melt too quickly or forests die off, the Earth could be locked into long-term damage. That's why scientists are advocating to cut emissions and protect ecosystems, because the cost of waiting could be far greater than the cost of acting now.
